# 🐍 Snake Soundness

A cyber-futuristic snake game inspired by **Soundness Labs** and **zero-knowledge proofs**.  
Your goal is to collect the right letters scattered on the grid to form the **Target Word** — proving your soundness one letter at a time.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Control the glowing snake with your keyboard **(arrow keys)** or the **on-screen gamepad** on mobile.  
- Each round gives you a **Target Word** (e.g., *verify*, *proof*, *attestation*).  
- Move through the grid to collect the correct sequence of letters.  
- The letters you collect appear dynamically in the **COLLECTED** section above the game grid.  
- Complete the word to finish your proof — and earn your score!
